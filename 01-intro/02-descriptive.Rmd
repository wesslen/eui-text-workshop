```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=12, fig.height=8, fig.path='Figs/',
                      echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
```

In this module we will discuss some quick descriptive statistics of text datasets. We'll be working with the dataset of inaugural speeches of U.S. Presidents

```{r}
library(quanteda)
tf <- textfile(file='../datasets/inaugTexts.csv', textField = 'inaugSpeech')
inaug <- corpus(tf)
#docnames(inaug) <- paste(inaug[['President']], inaug[["Year"]], sep=":")
```

The simplest of these is through the `summary()` method:

```{r}
summary(inaug)
```

We have already seen how to look at the most common features:

```{r}
presDfm <- dfm(inaugCorpus, ignoredFeatures = stopwords("english"), ngrams=c(1,3))
topfeatures(presDfm)
```

Other basic statistics of any dataset:
```{r}
# number of documents
ndoc(inaug)           
# number of tokens (total words)
ntoken(inaug)
# number of types (unique words)
ntype(inaug)
# number of documents and features in DFM
ndoc(presDfm)
nfeature(presDfm)
# extract feature labels and document names
head(features(presDfm), 20)
head(docnames(presDfm))
```

A common type of analysis to understand the content of a corpus is to extract collocations -- combinations of words that are more likely to appear together than what is expected based on their frequency distribution in the corpus as isolated words. There are different significance tests to identify whether a combination of words is a collocation or not (see the help file).

```{r}
collocations(inaug, size = 2, method = "all")
collocations(inaug, size = 3, method = "all")
```
 
A text document can also be characterized based on its readability and lexical diversity, which capture different aspects of its complexity. There are MANY indices that compute this. Note that each of these functions is applied to a different type of object (`corpus` or `dfm`).

```{r}
# readability
fk <- readability(inaug, "Flesch.Kincaid")
# lexical diversity
ld <- lexdiv(presDfm, "TTR")

# plot readability over time
require(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data = docvars(inaug), aes(x = Year, y = fk)) + 
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_blank(),
          axis.line = element_line(colour = "black")) +
    geom_smooth(alpha=0.2, linetype=1, color="grey70", method = "loess", span = .34) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("Flesch-Kincaid") +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line(alpha=0.3, size = 1) +
    ggtitle("Text Complexity in Presidential Inaugural Addresses") + 
    theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold"))
quartz(height=7, width=12)
print(p)

# plot lexical diversity over time
require(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data = docvars(inaug), aes(x = Year, y = ld)) + 
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_blank(),
          axis.line = element_line(colour = "black")) +
    geom_smooth(alpha=0.2, linetype=1, color="grey70", method = "loess", span = .34) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("Flesch-Kincaid") +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line(alpha=0.3, size = 1) +
    ggtitle("Text Complexity in Presidential Inaugural Addresses") + 
    theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold"))
quartz(height=7, width=12)
print(p)
```

We can identify documents that are similar to one another based on the frequency of words, using `similarity`:

```{r}
# document similarities
similarity(presDfm, "1985-Reagan", n=5, margin="documents")
similarity(presDfm, c("2009-Obama" , "2013-Obama"), n=5, margin="documents", method = "cosine")
similarity(presDfm, c("2009-Obama" , "2013-Obama"), n=5, margin="documents", method = "Hellinger")
similarity(presDfm, c("2009-Obama" , "2013-Obama"), n=5, margin="documents", method = "eJaccard")
```

And the opposite: term similarity based on the frequency with which they appear in documents.

Let's go back to the Charlotte dataset and try to filter for panther Tweets by two keyword hashtags:

```{r}
tweets <- read.csv("../datasets/CharlotteTweets20Sample.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

tweets$panthers <- grepl('#KeepPounding|#Panthers', tweets$body, ignore.case=TRUE)
table(tweets$panthers)
panthers.tweets <- tweets[tweets$panthers==TRUE, ]

twcorpus <- corpus(panthers.tweets$body)
collocations(twcorpus, size = 2, method = "all")

# we'll work with the tweets DFM
twdfm <- dfm(twcorpus, ignoredFeatures=c(
  stopwords("english"), "t.co", "https", "rt", "amp", "http", "t.c", "can"), ngrams=c(1,1))
# term similarities
sim <- similarity(twdfm, c("panthers", "fans"), margin="features", method="cosine")
head(sim$panthers, n=20)
head(sim$fans, n=20)
```

Each of these can be used to cluster documents:
```{r}
twdfm <- trim(twdfm, minCount=5, minDoc=3)
# hierarchical clustering - get distances on normalized dfm
pantDistMat <- dist(as.matrix(weight(twdfm, "relFreq")))
# hiarchical clustering the distance object
pantCluster <- hclust(pantDistMat)

# remove labels to avoid noisy plot
pantCluster$labels <- vector(mode="character", length=length(pantCluster$labels))
# plot as a dendrogram
plot(pantCluster)
```

Or to cluster terms:

```{r}
# word dendrogram with tf-idf weighting
wordDfm <- sort(weight(twdfm, "tfidf"))
wordDfm <- t(wordDfm)[1:50,]  # because transposed
wordDistMat <- dist(wordDfm)
wordCluster <- hclust(wordDistMat)
plot(wordCluster, xlab="", main="tf-idf Frequency weighting")
```

We'll see better ways to cluster documents and words in the last module of today's workshop.
